# Basic-Pseudo-Number-Generator
Contains source code for a basic number generator in c++

BasicAlgorithm.cpp contains the source code for a pretty basic random number generator.

RandomNumberGenerator.cpp is a fairly good pseudo number generator that uses the c function "rand()" (and "srand()" to set 
the seed the the generator) to generate random numbers.
