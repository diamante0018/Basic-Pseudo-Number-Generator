# Basic-Pseudo-Number-Generator
Contains source code for a basic number generator

BasicAlgorithm.cpp contains the source code for a pretty basic random number generator.

RandomNumberGenerator.cpp is a fairly good pseudo number generator that uses the c function "rand()" (and "srand()" to set 
the seed of the generator) to generate random numbers.

The .java files contains a more complex version of a random number generator. 
The user can manually adjust the range of the random number generator by modifying the source code.
The output is saved in a txt file.
